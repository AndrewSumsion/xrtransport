xrtransport will consist of a base runtime which is designed to completely transparently forward OpenXR calls
for the base API, along with any extensions it is configured to support at compile time. Obviously this will not
work by itself due to graphics considerations and platform-specific behavior. To get around this, API layers 
should be built on top of this base runtime to support specific client-server pairs, e.g. (Android/OpenGL ->
Windows/Vulkan)
