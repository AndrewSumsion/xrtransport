xrtransport will consist of a base runtime which is designed to completely transparently forward OpenXR calls
for the base API, along with any extensions it is configured to support at compile time. Obviously this will not
work by itself due to graphics considerations and platform-specific behavior. To get around this, API layers 
should be built on top of this base runtime to support specific client-server pairs, e.g. (Android/OpenGL ->
Windows/Vulkan)

xrEnumerateSwapchainImages needs to be custom implementation. The size of each element of its images parameter
is determined by which graphics extension is enabled which will need to be kept track of locally

TODO next: add a cleanup case for a pointer to a single header
