Initially, the server should only have three functions in its function table
- xrEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties
- xrEnumerateApiLayerProperties
- xrCreateInstance

Once an instance is created, it can fetch the rest of the function pointers using that instance
xrtransport only supports one instance per process for now.
The alternative is to build up a set of dispatch tables based on the types that functions pass in
For example, one dispatch table per XrInstance
Things like XrSession, when created, are added to a table that points to their XrInstance's dispatch table
This seems like a lot of work for a very small use case (multiple instances in one process) that probably won't be a problem.
In fact, inspection of the OpenXR Loader source code reveals that its trampoline functions only support one active OpenXR instance.
